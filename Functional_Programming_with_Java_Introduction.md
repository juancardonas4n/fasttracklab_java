# Functional Programming with Java Introduction

## Objetives

* understand principles, advantages, and capabilities of functional programming in Java
* be able to use functional interfaces and lambdas in Java programs
* be able to apply Stream API for processing collections of objects in Java programs

## Proposed Objectives

### You will achieve

* Define pure functions and anonymous functions
* Using immutable data types
* Processing collections of data using lambda functions, filters, maps and reduce functions

### What you must know

* to define Interfaces
* to define classes with methods
* to use Java's type system

### We expect that you learn

* Use and apply lambda functions in order to produce pure function inside our programs that can be used along with collections by using streams.
