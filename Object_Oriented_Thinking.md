# Object Oriented Thinking

## Objectives

* Earn about Object-Oriented Software Design that can help you to switch to the OOP way of thinking
* Get familiar with the SOLID principles and be able to use them for the majority of cases
* Gain an understanding of the design patterns approach and discover the main creational, structural, and behavioral design patterns as well as get practical experience of how to use them

## Proposed Objectives
