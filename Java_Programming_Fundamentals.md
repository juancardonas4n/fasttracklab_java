## Objectives

* develop programs with conditional statements and loops
* reuse code by breaking it into methods and pass arguments to method calls
* handle exceptions
* create objects, use their fields and methods associated with them
* extend classes and override methods
* understand the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism
* create and implement interfaces
* manage data collections by creating arrays, lists, and maps
* design, code, package, and run simple programs

## Syllabus

* Managing Program Flow
  * Evaluate conditions with if-else
    * `int` values to index a array
    * if-then-else statement in Java
    * nested if-then-else statements in Java
    * logical operators (`&&`)

    * `switch-case`statement
    * `break`statement
    * `default`keyword
    * Managing several case as one option
    * `switch-case`statement with `String`s
  * Create looping code blocks
    * `private`modifier
    * `static`modifier
    * `private state`
    * an `Array`of `String`s
    * Initialize and Array with values `{}`
    * Looping with 4 different kinds of loops.
    * `for`loop (`fori`shortcut on IDE for iteraction loop)
    * Array attribute `length`
    * foreach loop (`foreach`shortcut on IDE)
    * `while` loop with counter value iteractor
    * `do `while`loop 
    * `break`inside the `do while` loop
  * Create reusable code with methods
    * Refactor process on the IDE
    * Create `static` method with `void`value return
    * Create `static`methods that returns a value
    * Infinite loops with `while`
    * `break` inside the `while`loop
    * Code a sentinel code with input from `Scanner`
    * Calling methods inside an application
  * Create overloaded methods
    * Implements methods with same name but different signature
    * Implement variadic methods (`...`)
  * Pass arguments by reference and value
    * Java pass by copy the values of an argument
    * Object Variables are References
    * Passing String Values (A copy of String
* Exception Handling
  * Syntax errors vs exceptions
    * What is a syntax errors?
    * What is an exception?
    * Difference between syntax errors and exceptions?
  * Debug with IntelliJ IDEA
    * Defining and using breakpoints

    * Step out
    * Step over
    * Evaluate Expression (`Alt+F8`)
    * Watches collection
  * Handle Exception with try-catch
    * Shortcut Surround code
    * try - catch
    * Managing an exception
  * Create multiple catch block
    * Add multiple catch exception (**The way that he manages the multiple exceptions; is the correct?**)
    * Catching an Exception with Exception Class
    * Hierarchy for exceptions
  * Checked and Unchecked Exceptions
    * Unchecked exceptions (`RuntimeException`)
    * `InterruptedException`
    * Checked Exception
    * Definition of checked exception method
* Understanding Encapsulation
  * About Encapsulation
  * Use the Java `Runtime`classes
  * Wrap Code in `static` methods
  * Declare and use custom classes
  * Organize code with packages
* Use Custom Types
  * Create and use instance methods
  * Manage state with instance variables
  * Declare multiple constructor methods
  * Use static fields as constants
  * Declare and use enum types
  * Organize code with nested types

* Understanding Inheritance and Polimorphism
  * About inheritance and polimorphism
  * Extend classes and override methods
  * Cast objects as different types
  * Create and Implement interfaces

    * [Understanding Java 9 Modules](https://www.oracle.com/corporate/features/understanding-java-9-modules.html)
    * [Overview of What's new in Java 9](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/whatsnew/toc.htm#JSNEW-GUID-C23AFD78-C777-460B-8ACE-58BE5EA681F6)

  * Document code with Javadoc
  * Package classes in Jar Files
