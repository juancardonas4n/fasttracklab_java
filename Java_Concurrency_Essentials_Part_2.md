# 	Java Concurrency Essential (Part 2)

## Objetives

* discover what `ReentrantLock` is
* establish what conditional variables are
* use locks according to the critical section role
* allow multiple threads in a critical section
* synchronize multiple threads at a certain execution point
* find out what asynchronous computation is
* use `ExecutorService` and `Futures`
* review what a thread pool is
* implement concurrent divide-and-conquer algorithms using `ForkJoinPool`
* design parallel algorithms and explore what phases this process consists of
* measure the effectiveness of a parallel algorithm and compare it with a sequential one
